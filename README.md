## **Proposal 1: WeDo**

### What and why?
This is an interactive to-do list application. This app is a virtual version of year a planner book, but in addition to that, you can have mutual friends to share each other’s progression. In this app, friends who share mutual goals will supervise and support each other in meeting personal goals. It is easy to give up when building a habit or working towards a hard achievement. In addition to personal effort, the company of a friend who works equally hard toward their goals will benefit the process. 

### For whom?
This app targets students in highschool and higher, who has a complicated schedule and a clear idea of their personal goals and who has close and encouraging friendships. 

### How?
- Todo List Management
  - User can create, edit, and delete to-do list items in this application.
	- User can have a list view of the items, and user can also have a calendar view of the items. The list view of items is based on list categories, pass-due-date lists, and lists that are due today. The calendar view of items is based on dates and categories.
	- A list is unchecked when first created, and the user can check it upon completion.
	- A list is specific in date and optional in time.
	- User can archive a list and activate for later. An archive list does not need to be specific in date.
	- If user misses a list deadline, he/she can still check the list. If he/she changes the date of the list, a new list will be copied on the chosen date, and the previous one will be marked as moved. The user cannot check the previous one anymore.
	- User can create categories for the lists.
	- When user deletes a category, the app will remind the user to merge the lists to another existing category. If the user refuses to merge, associated lists will be deleted.
	- Each list must be under a category. One category can have no or multiple lists.
	- User can change the date, time, and category of each list.
- Planner Review
	- User can create general goals for each day on a monthly calendar.
	- User can display all the 12 months together, or users can display one month plan next to the todo list for reference.
- Friend Mechanism
	- User can search for another user based on email, and make a friend request.
	- User can agree to a friend request to become a mutual friend with the sender.
	- User can like a friend’s completed list, and the friend will receive the like.
	- User can remove a friend, and they will unsubscribe from the mutual friend upon removal.
- Result Review
	- User can see the histogram of the number of lists completed based on categories.
	- User can also see the pie chart of all categories, reflecting the percentage of list numbers completed.
- User Station
	- To log in, user can use username & password or two-factor verification via email
	- User must update preferred email to register
	- User can upload an optional profile photo
	- User can change UI features of the app, including color schemes, text styles, and more
	- User can delete the account
