## **Proposal 1: WeDo**

### What and why?
This is an interactive to-do list application. This app is a virtual version of year a planner book, but in addition to that, you can have mutual friends to share each other’s progression. In this app, friends who share mutual goals will supervise and support each other in meeting personal goals. It is easy to give up when building a habit or working towards a hard achievement. In addition to personal effort, the company of a friend who works equally hard toward their goals will benefit the process. 

### For whom?
This app targets students in highschool and higher, who has a complicated schedule and a clear idea of their personal goals and who has close and encouraging friendships. 

### How?
- Todo List Management
  - User can create, edit, and delete to-do list items in this application.
  - User can have a list view of the items, and user can also have a calendar view of the items. The list view of items is based on list categories, pass-due-date lists, and lists that are due today. The calendar view of items is based on dates and categories.
  - A list is unchecked when first created, and the user can check it upon completion.
  - A list is specific in date and optional in time.
  - User can archive a list and activate for later. An archive list does not need to be specific in date.
  - If user misses a list deadline, he/she can still check the list. If he/she changes the date of the list, a new list will be copied on the chosen date, and the previous one will be marked as moved. The user cannot check the previous one anymore.
  - User can create categories for the lists.
  - When user deletes a category, the app will remind the user to merge the lists to another existing category. If the user refuses to merge, associated lists will be deleted.
  - Each list must be under a category. One category can have no or multiple lists.
  - User can change the date, time, and category of each list.
- Planner Review
  - User can create general goals for each day on a monthly calendar.
  - User can display all the 12 months together, or users can display one month plan next to the todo list for reference.
- Friend Mechanism
  - User can search for another user based on email, and make a friend request.
  - User can agree to a friend request to become a mutual friend with the sender.
  - User can like a friend’s completed list, and the friend will receive the like.
  - User can remove a friend, and they will unsubscribe from the mutual friend upon removal.
- Result Review
  - User can see the histogram of the number of lists completed based on categories.
  - User can also see the pie chart of all categories, reflecting the percentage of list numbers completed.
- User Station
  - To log in, user can use username & password or two-factor verification via email
  - User must update preferred email to register
  - User can upload an optional profile photo
  - User can change UI features of the app, including color schemes, text styles, and more

### Scope
Considering the project’s multiple features, it is challenging for a group of 4-6 to complete within the semester.


## **Proposal 2: GoodOldMap**

### What and why?
This is an interactive map changing upon the user’s time set before modern time. Upon clicking on parts of the map, the application will display an image of the artwork and a soundtrack specific to the location and time. The user can click on the display to learn more about artworks and compositions in a specific space and time. The project collects information online to build a random yet concise sense of art and music.

### For whom?
This application is for children and teenagers who are curious to learn about art and culture. It provides geometric details for a more comprehensive understanding of space and cultural works.

### How?
- The user will be able to adjust the time zone for the map based on the unit of the year
- When clicking a portion of the map, the user will see a popup of random artwork and hear a random composition specific to the city (or country) and time. 
- When the user clicks on the popup, he/she will find a detailed explanation of the artwork and the composition. He/she will also find roughly 10 related works completed at this time and location.

## **Proposal 5: Break30 - a information cocoon breaker**

### What and why?

In today's world, individuals are frequently labeled and categorized by various recommendation systems. While these systems do enhance efficiency and keep users engaged within a single app, they also confine users within specific types of information and interests. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the "information cocoon." The continuous influx of similar content serves to polarize our perspectives by obstructing our exposure to diverse information.

Our app has a clear mission: to dismantle the information cocoon. We are committed to challenging the dominance of recommendation systems and providing our users with a healthy dose of randomness. 

### For whom?
- people who are sick of same content every day and want some new information
- people with interesting souls and willing to share with others
- people who don't want to spend hours on phone

### How?
- At specific, predetermined times, we deliver one image, one text snippet, and one video to our users. For instance, this could include a captivating image of a painting or an informative video on the art of making fried chicken.

- We actively encourage user engagement with our content. In a fixed 30-minute window, users have the opportunity to react to the content, generate their own content, and give credit to fellow contributors. This fosters a sense of community-driven knowledge sharing and interaction.

- Much like BeReal, our app allows users to connect with friends within the platform, but it eschews traditional chat features. People could see interactions for a post from friends only to avoid additional comment censorship. Instead, we emphasize the importance of content and knowledge exchange as the primary means of interaction, promoting meaningful connections based on shared interests and curiosity.

### Scope
- The system need to grab information from websites or from existing database to deliver information for users. We might also need a censorship algo for co
